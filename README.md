# ibm-expansions

So.. what does I-B-M stands for?


## What is this?
This is a node module inspired by [npm-expansions](https://github.com/npm/npm-expansions) that generates three-word-thingies based on the IBM acronym.

This was made for FUN and is meant to be used in that spirit, be good people and go code something awesome!
